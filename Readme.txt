I made this program for myself, mainly to cheat a little in games. It's not finished yet, but I will try to dedicate more time to the development of this program. It works only on windows.

It's functionality is - you add different types of inputs (keyboard or mouse) to the list, and push a certain key combination to start executing them, as simple as that.
